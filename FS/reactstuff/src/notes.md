create components in react. It should take employe number, name and salary through input, and a button called "compute gross salary". On clicking this button, 3 new input fields(read only) will pop up which will dioplay ta(20% of salary), hra(30% of salary), and da(90% of salary) and another input field(read only) which displays gross salary, which is a total of salary+ta+hra+da. I
In the next line we have a button called "compute net salary". Clicking it will sprout up two input fields(read only) called pt and tax. on clicking pt, it will display 2% of salary. On clicking tax, it will display 30% of salary. in the next line we have net salary button, which will pop up and show the result of gross salaray-(pt+tax). Do this in react using appropriate class components, states, functional components etc. Assume that I am a beginner in react and doing this for practice, so dont make it too complicated but it should work as stated
