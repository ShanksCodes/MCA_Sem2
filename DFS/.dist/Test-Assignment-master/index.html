        <p>Boosting the concept of Programming we bring forward a unique coding
            challenge. Blind coding is the new platform where each and every one of you
            has a chance to win.</p>
        <p>With the idea of imparting programming knowledge, Presenting Blind Coding, a
            simple coding competition where you'll be given even simpler problems to code.
            Sounds too easy? It isn't! The catch is that you will be forbidden to look at your
            code!</p>
